* WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

* WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

* WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event

* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

* WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist
